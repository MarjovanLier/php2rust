# php2rust

php2rust converts typed PHP into normal, readable Rust. It uses no AI. It reads the PHP
with the [Mago](https://github.com/carthage-software/mago) crates, takes the type of
every value from Mago's analyser, and writes Rust only when every part of the file
converts. Code it cannot convert yet stops the conversion and is listed, so each refusal
shows what to add to the tool next.

The behavioural contract is [docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md). Requirement IDs such as
P2R-46 in messages and tests point into it.

## Install

Clone the repository, then:

```sh
cargo install --locked --path .
```

`--locked` keeps every Mago crate on the pinned version.

## Use

```sh
php2rust input.php            # Rust on stdout
php2rust input.php -o out.rs  # Rust in out.rs
```

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Converted. |
| 1 | The file holds PHP that php2rust does not convert yet. Each problem is printed as `path:line:column: message`. Nothing is written. |
| 2 | The arguments are wrong, the file cannot be read, is not UTF-8 or is not valid PHP, or the output cannot be written. Nothing is written. |

## What converts so far

The input must start with `declare(strict_types=1);`. Version 1 is being built in
steps; today php2rust converts:

- `echo` of string and int values, one `print!` per argument
- functions with `int` and `string` parameters and an `int` or `void` return type,
  as `pub fn`
- calls to those functions, `return`, and `+`, `-`, `*`, `%` and unary minus on ints
- integer literals in every PHP form, and single-quoted and double-quoted strings

Everything else stops the conversion, for example classes, variables other than
parameters, `if` and loops, `/` (use `intdiv()`), floats and other built-in functions.
Statements are written on one line each; a statement that rustfmt would split stops too.

## Known differences from PHP

- An `int` that overflows in `+`, `-`, `*`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `++`, `--` or unary
  minus: PHP turns it into a `float`. Rust panics in a debug build, and in a release
  build the value wraps silently unless the crate sets `overflow-checks = true` in
  `[profile.release]`.
- `%` of `PHP_INT_MIN` by `-1`: PHP gives `0`, Rust panics in every build.
- `intdiv(PHP_INT_MIN, -1)`, and division by zero in `intdiv()` or `%`: PHP throws an
  error (exit code 255 when uncaught), Rust panics (exit code 101) with a different
  message.
- Reading a list at a negative index or past its end: PHP warns and gives `null`. Rust
  panics.
- Comments and docblocks are not copied (version 1).

## Development

The tests need PHP 8.5 on `PATH` and the Rust toolchain pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml` (`rustup toolchain install` installs it). Each folder under
`tests/cases`, `tests/stops` and `tests/errors` is one test. To rewrite every
`expected.rs` and `expected.txt` from the current output:

```sh
PHP2RUST_BLESS=1 cargo test --test folders
```
